# Detecting low volatility anomaly in stock markets

### visualize sampling in a polytope 
### Sample approximate uniformly points from a random generated polytope using the implmented in volesti random walks, for various walk lengths. For each sample compute the PSRF and report on the results.
### Implement Gibbs sampler for uniform sampling from a polytope in C++ following the code structure of volesti.
